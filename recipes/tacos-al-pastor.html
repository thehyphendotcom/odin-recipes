    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tacos al Pastor are a popular Mexican dish made with marinated pork that is cooked on a vertical spit, similar to shawarma. The pork is typically marinated in a blend of dried chilies, spices, and pineapple juice, giving it a unique and flavorful taste. The meat is thinly sliced and served on corn tortillas, often garnished with chopped onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.</p>
