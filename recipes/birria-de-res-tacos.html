    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Birria de Res Tacos are a delicious Mexican dish made with slow-cooked beef (res) that is marinated in a flavorful blend of spices and chilies. The beef is cooked until tender and then shredded, making it perfect for filling tacos. These tacos are often served with a side of consommé, which is a rich broth made from the cooking juices of the beef, allowing you to dip the tacos for added flavor.</p>
